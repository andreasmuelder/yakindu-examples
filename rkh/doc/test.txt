\n The goal in this section is to explain how to test a state machine 
using the RKH framework and its recommended test fixture. To do that is 
proposed a lot of complete state machines, which are shown in the 
following figures. 

Also, this section summarizes the main rules and concepts for making the most 
out of RKH features.
